# LoginSignUp component

##  Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This React component provides a simple login/signup interface for users.

### Description
The LoginSignUp component is designed to allow users to either log in or sign up. It includes input fields for email and password, and if the action is set to sign up, it also includes a field for the user's name.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



### Usage
To use the LoginSignUp component, simply import it into your React application and place it where needed within your component tree.

```javascript

import React from 'react';
import LoginSignUp from './LoginSignUp';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <LoginSignUp />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

### Features

..* Allows users to either log in or sign up.
..* Input fields for email and password.
..* Additional input field for name when signing up.
..* Option to reset password when logging in.



### File Structure
..* loginSignup.jsx: Contains the main component code.
..* loginSignup.css: Contains the styles for the component.
..* Assets: Contains images used in the component.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
